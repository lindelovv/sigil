## About
Simple rendering engine built learning the Vulkan API and more advanced graphics programming techniques.\
~~Currently working on PBR material setup.~~ (Reimpl everything in odin first)

Built & tested on Linux using gcc-13, shaderc-v2024.0 and meson 1.4. Some libraries are set up with custom meson patches in the repo to work on computers without pkg-config, the current setup works on some windows systems but not for others (to be investigated).
